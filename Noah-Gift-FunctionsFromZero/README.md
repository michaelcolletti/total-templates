## Configure the Development Environment


## Cloud Development Environments

To ensure a consistent developer workspace with minimal setup effort, consider using cloud-based development environments:

- **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** - Microsoft's cloud development environment that works directly with GitHub repositories
- **[Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/)** - Open-source development environment platform
- **[Gemini Code Assist](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/overview)** (formerly Cloud Code) - Google's AI-powered coding assistant
- **[Azure DevOps with Codespaces](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/github-codespaces-azure-devops-repo/)** - Using GitHub Codespaces with Azure DevOps repositories

*Using these environments ensures consistent development experiences across your team and eliminates "works on my machine" problems. Similarly, using containerization in the dev workflow providing dev environment in devcontainers also makes this easier to manage.*

### Setup Scaffolding 

- Use virtual environments for Python (see python)
- iPython is a great way to interact like on a Jupyter Notebooks.
- Makefiles for easier build process and automatable, consistent way to manage the lifecyle
